# An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
# Array elements can be accessed by index. Indexes are bydefault assigned to array elements
# Time Complexity: O(1)/O(n) ( O(1) -> for inserting elements at the end of the array
#
#                               O(n) ->for inserting elements at the beginning
